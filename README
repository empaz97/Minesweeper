Minesweeper

CS 338: Graphical User Interfaces

This game is the traditional Minesweeper game. It does not require any additional modules. The main function is located in the file Minesweeper.java

An executable .jar file can be found at:
./Minesweeper/Minesweeper.jar

The image resources were all created by me and are located in the images/ folder within the file directory.

Under the Game menu, you can choose to start a new game, or set the difficulty which starts a new game with that difficulty. The difficulties are as follows:
Beginner: 8x8, 10 mines 
Intermediate: 16x16, 40 mines
Expert: 24x24, 99 mines
Custom: set by user

You can also start a new game by pressing the smiley face at the top!

The goal of this game is to correctly open all squares not containing a mine. If you open a mine, you die! You click a square to open it, and upon being opened, if there is no mine in the square, it will display a number saying the number of adjacent (all eight squares touching a side or corner) mines. If there are 0 adjacent mines, it will chain open all adjacent squares. You can right click a sqsquare to flag it as possibly having a mine under it. Another right click gives it a question mark which says you're unsure, and another right click toggles it back to un-marked.
